## [Reasoning with Language Model Prompting: A Survey](./Papers/LLM_Reasoning_by_Prompting_Survey_ACL_2023.pdf)
1. Reasoning abilities in pre-trained large language models can be unlocked by prompting strategies.
2. Two broad categories of methods for enhanching reasoning in LLMs via prompting:
    a. Strategy-enhanced prompting
    b. Knowledge-enchanced prompting

### Strategy-enhanced prompting:
As the name suggests, it is about devising an effective strategy for prompting, to enable LLMs to give desired responses via adequate reasoning. This method category has three specific sub-methods:
1. **Prompt Engineering**: Perhaps the most popular and well-known method of eliciting reasoning based responses in LLMs. This method is further divided into two:
   a. Single-stage prompts:
   b. Multi-stage prompts:
